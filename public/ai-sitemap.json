    {
      "question": "What is ShapeShyft?",
      "answer": "ShapeShyft is a platform that transforms unstructured LLM (Large Language Model) outputs into reliable, type-safe REST APIs. You define your output format using JSON Schema, and ShapeShyft ensures the LLM response matches that structure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which LLM providers does ShapeShyft support?",
      "answer": "ShapeShyft supports OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Anthropic (Claude 3, Claude 2), Google (Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra), and any custom LM server with an OpenAI-compatible API."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does structured output work?",
      "answer": "You define a JSON Schema for your desired output format. ShapeShyft uses advanced prompt engineering to instruct the LLM to return data matching your schema, then validates the response before returning it to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free tier?",
      "answer": "Yes, ShapeShyft offers a free tier with limited requests. Paid plans are available for higher usage limits, multiple projects, and priority support."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to handle prompt engineering?",
      "answer": "No, ShapeShyft handles the prompt engineering for you. You provide the instructions and context for what you want the LLM to do, and ShapeShyft constructs the optimal prompt to get structured output."
